@node Settings Page Introduction
@section Settings Page Introduction

This page is kind of lame, with the selection buttons on the
bottom.  Unfortunately, a limitation on the @code{yad}
command makes it difficult to use form buttons to open
other pages.

@strong{There is no cancel or exit button}.  Use the @key{Esc}
key to exit the page.

@node Set SRM Globals Page
@section Set SRM Globals Page

This page of paired fields are added as global instructions
in the generated SRM file.  Typically, one would set include
instructions with these paired settings.

@node Set Labels Page
@section Set Labels Page

This page allows the developer to enter labels for the table's
fields to be used throughout the generated SRM file.  For example,
if a Person table has an @emph{fname} field, the developer might
enter @emph{First Name} as the default label on this page.

These settings are global, in that the defined labels will be
included in every generated schema.  However, the value can be
overridden on the fields lines on the interactions page.

@node Set Links Page
@section Set Links Page

This page allows the developer to specify session variable
associations with fields.  If a field is associated with a
session variable, procedure parameters and insert values
for that field will use the session variable instead of
looking for user input.


@node Set Procedure Tag Page
@section Set Procedure Tag Page

This page sets only one value, the @emph{Procedure Tag}.  The
@emph{procedure tag} is a string value that will be inserted
into a procedure name between the table name and the procedure
action.  For example, if the current table is @emph{Person},
the normal list procedure name would be @emph{App_Person_List},
but with the @emph{procedure tag} set to @strong{AsStudent},
if would be @emph{App_Person_AsStudent_List}.
