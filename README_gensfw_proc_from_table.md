# Supplemental Program *gensfw_proc_from_table*

This creates MySQL stored procedures from table definitions.  Although
(at the time of this writing) this tool is somewhat rudimentary, my plan
is to build this into a tool that can easily generate various scripts in
a deployment script to help with customizations.  It is meant to be a
more flexible command line tool than *gensfw*, which primarily works as
a GUI application.

I will resist writing more now because the tool is still evolving.
