# Project gensfw

This project is an excuse to practice BASH application programming using
[YAD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog/).

The other purpose for this project is to aid in the creation of
[Schema Framework](https://github.com/cjungmann/schemafw) scripts.

## Usage

`gensfw DatabaseName TableName`
for example:
~~~sh
 $ ./gensfw TestGenSFW Person
~~~

## Other Info

I just started to work on this project.  This README is incomplete
and does not yet contain complete instructions nor even a complete
description.

The reason I am creating a repository for the project is because it
is now referenced by another project of mine,
[mysqlcb](https://github.com/cjungmann/libmysqlcb), which contains the
*xmlify* utility on which this *gensfw* project depends.
